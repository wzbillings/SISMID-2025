Use function-writing and functional programming techniques to deal with applied epidemiology problems.\n1. Optimize your own function with `optim()`.\n1. Simulate and solve differential equations with `deSolve`.\n\n# `optim()`\n\n## What is `optim()`\n\n- Generic R interface to optimization algorithms.\n- **Optimization**: for a function $f(x)$, find $x^\\star$ so that $f(x^\\star) \\geq f(x)$ for any other $x$.\n- Takes a function to be **minimized** as an argument. (If you want the maximum, you need to put a negative sign.)\n\n## Simple example {.scrollable}\n\n- Find the maximum value of $f(x) = \\sin(x)e^{-x^2}$.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncurve(\n\tsin(x) * exp(-x^2),\n\tfrom = -2, to = 2, n = 1000\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ModuleXX-optim-differential-equations_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptim(\n\tpar = your initial guess to start at,\n\tfn = the function to optimize,\n\tmethod = the method to use for optimization,\n\tcontrol = a list of other parameters\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres <- optim(\n\tpar = 0,\n\tfn = \\(x) sin(x) * exp(-x^2),\n\tmethod = \"BFGS\",\n\tcontrol = list(fnscale = -1) # This gets the maximum\n)\nres\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$par\n[1] 0.6532841\n\n$value\n[1] 0.396653\n\n$counts\nfunction gradient \n       8        7 \n\n$convergence\n[1] 0\n\n$message\nNULL\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncurve(\n\tsin(x) * exp(-x^2),\n\tfrom = -2, to = 2, n = 1000\n)\nabline(h = res$value, col = \"red\")\nabline(v = res$par, col = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ModuleXX-optim-differential-equations_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Arguments explained\n\n- `par` is a vector of your parameter values. You need to pick starting values for the algorithm, usually the choice isn't super important. (It can be for complicated problems.)\n- `fn` is the function you want to minimize (or maximize with the `fnscale = -1` control argument).\n- `method` is the optimizer to use, this is a really technical choice. I prefer `BFGS` but `Brent` is also good for 1 parameter problems and `Nelder-Mead` is usually good for 2+ parameter problems if `BFGS` isn't working.\n- `control` has a lot of complicated options that you usually won't need, `fnscale = -1` is the main one to know about.\n\n## Why use `optim()` {.incremental}\n\n- `lm()` and `glm()`, etc., do all of that stuff for me? Why do I need to do it by hand?\n- Sometimes you have a problem that doesn't fit neatly into a pre-written model!\n- We'll get to an example where this is true, but let's build our way up.\n\n## Optim sampling example {.scrollable}\n\n- Suppose you're in charge of monitoring mosquito traps for West Nile Virus at some health department (see, e.g., PMCID: PMC2631741).\n- You have 20 different traps you can check, and at each trap you select 10 mosquitoes for testing. We don't have enough money or good enough equipment to test all of those mosquitoes, so we pool them together and get an overall yes (1) or no (0) for presence of mosquitoes.\n- This month, 7 out of 20 traps tested positive.\n- Estimate the underlying mosquito infection risk from the pooled data using maximum likelihood.\n\n. . .\n\n- Note that you can do this as a binomial `glm()`. But this won't be true in our next example.\n- Let's work through the math you need.\n\n. . .\n\n- Given an infection rate, $p$, the probability that pool $i$ tests positive is\n$$\nP(+) = 1 - (1 - p)^{10}\n$$\n- The probability that 7 pools out of 20 tested positive is then\n$$\n{{7}\\choose{20}} \\bigg(1 - (1 - p)^{10}\\bigg)^7 \\bigg((1 - p)^{10}\\bigg)^{20-7}\n$$\n- This is written in R as `dbinom(7, size = 20, prob = 1 - (1 - p)^10)`.\n- For technical reasons, it is easier to minimize the negative log likelihood than it is to directly maximize the likelihood.\n- You should write a function that gives the negative log likelihood and pass this function to `optim()` to find the best value of $p$.\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninitial_guess <- 7 / 20\n\n# You could write out the math for this function by hand if you wanted to\n# But dbinom uses some nice tricks to be faster and more accurate.\nnll <- function(p) {\n  nll <- -dbinom(7, size = 20, prob = 1 - (1 - p)^10, log = TRUE)\n  return(nll)\n}\n\noptim(\n\tpar = initial_guess,\n\tfn = nll,\n\tmethod = \"L-BFGS-B\", # Or \"Brent\"\n\tlower = 0.001,\n\tupper = 0.999\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$par\n[1] 0.04217128\n\n$value\n[1] 1.690642\n\n$counts\nfunction gradient \n      15       15 \n\n$convergence\n[1] 0\n\n$message\n[1] \"CONVERGENCE: REL_REDUCTION_OF_F <= FACTR*EPSMCH\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- The output tells us that $p \\approx 0.02$ has the minimal negative log-likelihood at 1.69, so from the data we have, this is the most likely mosquito infection rate.\n\n## Bonus stage!\n\n- Usually getting an approximate Wald-type confidence interval is very easy with `optim()`.\n- We need to refit the model with `hessian = TRUE`. (Math terms: the Hessian returned here is the negative Fisher information matrix. The standard errors of the parameters are the square roots of the diagnol of the inverse Fisher information matrix.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres <- optim(\n\tpar = 0.1,\n\tfn = nll,\n\tmethod = \"L-BFGS-B\",\n\tlower = 0.00001,\n\tupper = 0.99999,\n\thessian = TRUE\n)\nest <- res$par\nse <- sqrt(diag(solve(res$hessian)))\n\n# Approximate CI\nci_lower <- est - 1.96 * se\nci_upper <- est + 1.96 * se\nc(ci_lower, ci_upper)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.01137851 0.07296406\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- So in our report, we could say that we estimate an 4.2\\% WNV infection risk for mosquitoes in our area with a 95\\% CI of about 1.1\\% to 7.3\\%.\n\n## You try it! {.scrollable}\n\n- Let's extend the binomial example to a situation where we don't have a built-in ML option in R.\n- In real life, your mosquito traps are probably **heterogeneous**. One process that can contribute to heterogeneity is **zero-inflation**: at some sites, there are no mosquitoes with WNV because WNV hasn't been introduced to that area yet.\n- So now we know that if we observe a negative trap, it could be because there's no WNV at all, or because we didn't catch any mosquitoes with WNV. Call the probability that WNV has been introduced into the trap region $\\kappa$.\n- Estimate $p$, the mosquito infection rate, and $\\kappa$, the zero-inflation probability, assuming that 7 of 20 pools were positive and each pool had 10 mosquitos.\n\n. . .\n\n- We introduce $\\kappa$ into our model by now modeling the probability that a pool tests positive as\n$$\nP(+) = \\kappa\\bigg(1 - (1 - p)^{10}\\bigg).\n$$\n- Now you just need to handle optimizing two parameters at one time. The input to your function needs to be a length two vector.\n\n. . .\n\n- Hint: Your initial guess should be a length two vector (`c(..., ...)`) and your optimization function should look like this.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnll_zip <- function(par) {\n\tp <- par[1]\n\tkappa <- par[2]\n\t\n\t...\n\t\n\treturn(nll)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n- Hint: when you call `optim()` you need to make sure that `par`, `lower`, and `upper` are all length-two vectors.

(Or, the negative log-likelihood of the sample is the *sum* of the negative log-likelihood of each datapoint.) Using the `mos-nyc.csv` dataset, which describes the number of positive pools out of total pools collected for some counties in New York State, estimate the mosquito infection rate under both the simple and mixture models. Assume these samples use 50 mosquitoes per pool instead of 10.\n\n- For an extra super bonus problem (not solved here), figure out how to combine your `optim()` code with what we learned about bootstrapping to compare the Wald-type CI from the Hessian with a bootstrap CI.\n\n# `deSolve`\n\n## Differential equations and other types of horoscopes\n\n- A differential equation is an equation with a derivative in it. E.g:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 x = 0\n$$\nis a differential equation from physics.\n- Here **x** is position, **t** is time, and $\\omega$ is some constant.\n- This differential equation describes how springs and pendulums move over time.\n\n## Spring motion {.scrollable}\n\n- This differential equation describes how a spring moves over time.\n\n![Source: https://vamosarema.com/](..\\images\\spring.jpg)\n\n. . .\n\n- Through math magic, we can figure out that the curve traced out by the spring position has to be\n$$\nf(x) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\n- Where $A$ and $B$ are real numbers that are determined by where the spring starts and its initial speed.\n- Since we know this, we can make a plot of the spring movement.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Parameters\nomega <- 4 * pi  # angular frequency = sqrt(k / m)\nA <- -2          # initial displacement\nB <- 1 / omega         # initial velocity divided by omega\n\n# Time vector\nt <- seq(0, 2, by = 0.01)  # 0 to 2 seconds\n\n# Analytical solution\nx <- A * cos(omega * t) + B * sin(omega * t)\n\n# Plot\nplot(t, x, type = \"l\", col = \"blue\", lwd = 2,\n     xlab = \"Time (seconds)\", ylab = \"Position\",\n     main = \"Spring movement\")\nabline(h = 0, col = \"gray\", lty = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ModuleXX-optim-differential-equations_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n- So what do we do if we don't know the math magic?\n- We use a **numerical solver**. In R, the best one is in the `deSolve` package.

I'll arbitrarily set $\\beta = 0.01$ and $\\gamma = 0.5$ since I know it will make a good picture.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsir_parms <- c(beta = 0.01, gamma = 0.5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n- Time points: it doesn't really matter what we choose as long as it goes far enough out to see the patterns we're interest in and is fine-grained enough to get good detail.

For a quick introduction (requires calculus) I recommend \"Differential Equations in 24 Hours\" by Scott Imhoff.\n- For a no-code no-calculus exploration of epidemiology DE's, take a look at Andreas Handel's R packages [DSAIRM](https://cran.csail.mit.edu/web/packages/DSAIRM/index.html) (within-host models) and [DSAIDE](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages//DSAIDE/index.html) (between-host models).\n- Or there are MANY other SISMID courses about ODE modeling.\n\n## Bonus stage: `deSolve` AND `optim` {.scrollable}\n\n- If you have observed epidemic data, you can actually estimate the parameters of an ODE system.\n- It's much more difficult than estimating a linear model, though.\n- Suppose we've observed the data in `SIR-observed.csv` and we want to estimate parameters assuming an SIR model fits the best. Note that we typically only observe case counts in real data, so that's what is in this data.\n- Let's walk through a quick implementation of a model fit. First load the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"SIR-observed.csv\"))\nhead(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| day| total_cases|\n|---:|-----------:|\n|   1|           1|\n|   2|           5|\n|   3|          22|\n|   4|          44|\n|   5|         109|\n|   6|         271|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- We can use all the stuff we already built for an SIR model `deSolve` run. The hard part is figuring out how to fit it to our data.\n\n. . .\n\n- The easiest way is to use the SSR on the case counts, so we'll minimize\n$$\nSSR = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\bigg(I - \\hat{I}(\\beta, \\gamma)\\bigg)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{I}(\\beta, \\gamma)$ are the case counts predicted by an SIR model with parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n- So we need to define a function for optim that takes the parameters as an argument, calculates the $\\hat{I}$ values for those parameters, and then gets the SSR between the observed and predicted case counts.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsir_pred <- function(par) {\n\tsir_parms <- c(beta = par[1], gamma = par[2])\n\tsir_initial_condition <- c(S = 1000, I = 1, R = 0)\n\ttimes <- seq(1, 100, 1)\n\t\n\tsim <- deSolve::ode(\n\t\ty = sir_initial_condition,\n\t\ttimes = times,\n\t\tfun = sir_ode,\n\t\tparms = sir_parms\n\t)\n\t\n\ti_hat <- sim[, \"I\"]\n\tfit_ssr <- sum((dat$total_cases - i_hat) ^ 2)\n\treturn(fit_ssr)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- Now we can run `optim()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres <- optim(\n\tpar = c(0.1, 0.1),\n\tfn = sir_pred,\n\thessian = TRUE,\n\tmethod = \"L-BFGS-B\",\n\tlower = c(0, 0)\n)\n\npoint_sir <- res$par\nse_sir <- sqrt(diag(solve(res$hessian)))\nci_sir <- point_sir + outer(se_sir, c(-1.96, 1.96))\n\nout <- cbind(point_sir, ci_sir) |> round(5)\nrownames(out) <- c(\"beta\", \"gamma\")\ncolnames(out) <- c(\"point\", \"lower\", \"upper\")\nout\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|      |   point|   lower|   upper|\n|:-----|-------:|-------:|-------:|\n|beta  | 3.62954| 3.40695| 3.85213|\n|gamma | 0.04126| 0.04124| 0.04128|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- We can see that we're quite confidence in our estimates of $\\beta \\approx 3.6$ and $\\gamma \\approx 0.04$.\n\n. . .\n\n- The problem with that is that those are nowhere close to the parameters I used to simulate the data (beta = 0.001, gamma = 0.05).\n- These differential equation models are hard to optimize! But there are other SISMID modules that focus on how to make these models work right, we just want you to be able to program them.\n\n. . .\n\n- Part of the problem is that this is very sensitive to the choice of optimizer. If we rewrite our function to implicitly have the 0 boundary constraint we can use unconstrained optimizers.\n- Some are much worse for this problem (Nelder-Mead) and others (simulated annealing) can be better. In particular, simulated annealing is stochastic and will sometimes generate a very good answer and sometimes will not.\n- Getting a handle on these kind of problems requires a lot of practice and involves a lot of stuff that we unfortunately don't have time to talk about.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsir_pred <- function(par) {\n\tsir_parms <- c(beta = par[1], gamma = par[2])\n\tsir_initial_condition <- c(S = 1000, I = 1, R = 0)\n\ttimes <- seq(1, 100, 1)\n\t\n\t# New part\n\t# Return a huge number if the paramaters are negative\n\tif (any(par <= 0)) return(1e12)\n\t\n\tsim <- deSolve::ode(\n\t\ty = sir_initial_condition,\n\t\ttimes = times,\n\t\tfun = sir_ode,\n\t\tparms = sir_parms\n\t)\n\t\n\ti_hat <- sim[, \"I\"]\n\tfit_ssr <- sum((dat$total_cases - i_hat) ^ 2)\n\treturn(fit_ssr)\n}\n\nset.seed(103)\nres <- optim(\n\tpar = c(0.1, 0.1),\n\tfn = sir_pred,\n\thessian = TRUE,\n\t# Use simulated annealing, which can be better for these kind of problems.\n\tmethod = \"SANN\"\n)\n\npoint_sir <- res$par\nse_sir <- sqrt(diag(solve(res$hessian)))\nci_sir <- point_sir + outer(se_sir, c(-1.96, 1.96))\n\nout <- cbind(point_sir, ci_sir) |> round(5)\nrownames(out) <- c(\"beta\", \"gamma\")\ncolnames(out) <- c(\"point\", \"lower\", \"upper\")\nout\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|      |   point|   lower|   upper|\n|:-----|-------:|-------:|-------:|\n|beta  | 0.00100| 0.00100| 0.00100|\n|gamma | 0.05441| 0.05438| 0.05445|\n:::\n:::\n",
