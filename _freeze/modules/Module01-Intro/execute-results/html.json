The **Source/Editor**:\n\n</br> \n\n- \"Analysis\" Script\n\n- Static copy of what you did (reproducibility)\n\n- Top by default\n\n2. The **R Console**: \"interprets\" whatever you type:\n\n- Calculator\n- Try things out interactively, then add to your editor\n- Bottom by default\n\n## Source / Editor\n\n-   Where files open to\n-   Have R code and comments in them\n-   Where code is saved\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rstudio_script.png){width=200%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## R Console\n\n-   Where code is executed (where things happen)\n-   You can type here for things interactively\n-   Code is **not saved**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rstudio_console.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## RStudio\n\nUseful RStudio \"cheat sheet\": <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rstudio_sheet.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='RStudio' width=65%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## RStudio Layout\n\nIf RStudio doesn't look the way you want (or like our RStudio), then do:\n\nIn R Studio Menu Bar go to View Menu --\\> Panes --\\> Pane Layout\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/pane_layout.png){fig-align='center' width=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Workspace/Environment\n\n-   Tells you what **objects** are in R\n-   What exists in memory/what is loaded?/what did I read in?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rstudio_environment.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Workspace/History\n\n-   Shows previous commands. Good to look at for debugging, but **don't rely** on it.\n-   Also type the \"up\" and \"down\" key in the Console to scroll through previous commands\n\n## Workspace/Other Panes\n\n-   **Files** - shows the files on your computer of the directory you are working in\n-   **Viewer** - can view data or R objects\n-   **Help** - shows help of R commands\n-   **Plots** - pictures and figures\n-   **Packages** - list of R packages that are loaded in memory\n\n## Getting Started\n\n-   In R Studio Menu Bar go to File Menu --\\> New File --\\> R Script\n-   Save the blank R script as Module1.R\n\n## Explaining output on slides\n\nIn slides, the R command/code will be in a box, and then directly after it, will be the output of the code starting with `[1]`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"I'm code\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"I'm code\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo `print(\"I'm code\")` is the command and `[1] \"I'm code\"` is the output.\n\n</br>\n\nCommands/code and output written as inline text will be typewriter blue font. For example `code`\n\n## R as a calculator\n\nYou can do basic arithmetic in R, which I surprisingly use all the time.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 * 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2^3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## R as a calculator\n\n- The R console is a full calculator\n- Arithmetic operators:\n    - `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` are add, subtract, divide and multiply\n    - `^` or `**` is power\n    - parentheses -- `(` and `)` -- work with order of operations \n    - `%%` finds the remainder\n    \n\n## Execute / Run Code\n\nTo execute or run a line of code (i.e., command), you just put your cursor on the command and then:\n\n  1. Press Run (which you will find at the top of your Console pane)\n\n  OR\n\n  2. Press `Cmd + Return` (iOS) OR `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows).\n\nTo execute or run multiple lines of code, you need to highlight the code you want to run and then follow option 1 or 2.\n\n## Mini exercise \n\nExecute `5+4` from your .R file, and then find the answer 9 in the Console.\n\n## Commenting in Scripts\n\nThe syntax `#` creates a comment, which means anything to the right of `#` will not be executed / run\n\nCommenting is useful to:\n\n1. Create headers for R Scripts\n2. Create sections within an R Script\n3. Explain what is happening in your code \n\n## Commenting an R Script header\n\nAdd a comment header to Module1.R.  This is the one I typically use, but you may have your own preference.  The goal is that you are consistent so that future you / collaborators can make sense of your code.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Title: Module 1\n### Author: Amy Winter \n### Objective: Mini Exercise - Developing first R Script\n### Date: 15 July 2024\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Commenting to create sections\n\nYou can also create sections within your code by ending a comment with 4 hash marks. **This is very useful for creating an outline of your R Script.** The \"Outline\" can be found in the top right of the your Source pane\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Section 1 Header ####\n## Section 2 Sub-header ####\n### Section 3 Sub-sub-header ####\n#### Section 4 Sub-sub-sub-header ####\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/outline.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Commenting to explain code\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## this # is still a comment\n### you can use many #'s as you want\n\n# sometimes you have a really long comment,\n#    like explaining what you are doing\n#    for a step in analysis. \n# Take it to another line\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI tend to use:\n\n-   One hash mark with a space to describe what is happening in the following few lines of code\n-   One hash mark with no space after a command to list specifics \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Practicing my arithmetic\n5+2\n3*5\n9/8\n\n5+2 #5 plus 2 \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Object - Basic terms\n\n**Object** - an object is something that can be worked with in R - can be lots of different things!\n\n-   a scalar / number\n-   a vector\n-   a matrix of numbers\n-   a list\n-   a plot\n-   a function\n\n... many more\n\n## Objects\n\n- You can create objects from within the R environment and from files on your computer\n- R uses `<-` to assign values to an object name \n- Note: Object names are case-sensitive, i.e. `X` and `x` are different\n- Here are examples of creating five different objects:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumber.object <- 3\ncharacter.object <- \"blue\"\nvector.object1 <- c(2,3,4,5)\nvector.object2 <- paste0(c(\"b\", \"t\", \"u\"), c(8,4,2))\nmatrix.object <- matrix(data=vector.object1, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote, `c()`, `paste0()`, and `matrix()` are functions, which we will talk more about in module 2.\n\n## Object names  - Good coding\n\n- In general, any object name can be typed into R.\n- However, only some are considered \"valid\". If you use a non-valid object name,\nyou will have to enclose it in backticks \\``like this`\\` for R to recognize it.\n- From the R documentation:\n\n> A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as \".2way\" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.\n\n- Reserved words: `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `for`, `in`,\n`next`, `break`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, `NA_integer_`,\n`NA_real_`, `NA_Complex_`, `_NA_Character`, `...`, `..1`, `..2`, `..3`, and so on.\n\n## Object names  - Good coding\n\n| Valid        | Invalid |\n|--------------|---------|\n| `my_object`    | `my-data` |\n| `the.vector`   | `2data`   |\n| `num12`        | `for`     |\n| `measles_data` | `.9data`  |\n| `.calc`        | `xX~mŷ_δätą~Xx` |\n\n\n## Object assingment - Good coding\n\n`=` and `<-` can both be used for assignment, but `<-` is better coding practice, because sometimes `=` doesn't work and we want to distinguish between the logical operator `==`. We will talk about this more, later.\n\n## Mini Exercise\n\nTry creating one or two of these objects in your R script\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumber.object <- 3\ncharacter.object <- \"blue\"\nvector.object1 <- c(2,3,4,5)\nvector.object2 <- paste0(c(\"b\", \"t\", \"u\"), c(8,4,2))\nmatrix.object <- matrix(data=vector.object1, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Objects \n\nNote, you can find these objects now in your Environment pane.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/global_env.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you can print them anytime (i.e, see them in the Console) by executing (running) the object.  For example,\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncharacter.object\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"blue\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmatrix.object\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    3\n[2,]    4    5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Lists\n\nList is a special data class, that can hold vectors, strings, matrices, models, list of other lists.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist.object <- list(number.object, vector.object2, matrix.object)\nlist.object\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"b8\" \"t4\" \"u2\"\n\n[[3]]\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    3\n[2,]    4    5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Useful R Studio Shortcuts\n\nWill certainly save you time\n\n- `Cmd + Return` (iOS) OR `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) in your script evaluates current line/selection\n    -   It's like copying and pasting the code into the console for it to run.\n- pressing Up/Down in the Console allows you to navigate command history\n\nSee <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/keyboard_shortcuts> for many more\n\n\n## RStudio helps with \"tab completion\"\n\nIf you start typing a object, RStudio will show you options that you can choose without typing out the whole object.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/tab.completion.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n-   RStudio makes working in R easier\n-   The Editor is for static code like R Scripts\n-   The Console is for testing code that can't be saved\n-   Commenting is your new best friend\n-   In R we create objects that can be viewed in the Environment pane and used anytime\n-   An object is something that can be worked with in R\n-   Use `<-` syntax to create objects\n\n\n## Mini Exercise\n\n1. Create a new number object and name it `my.object`\n2. Create a vector of 4 numbers and name it `my.vector` using the `c()` function\n3. Add `my.object` and `my.vector` together using an arithmetic operator\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThese are the materials we looked through, modified, or extracted to complete this module's lecture.\n\n-   [\"Introduction to R for Public Health Researchers\" Johns Hopkins University](https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/)\n-   Some RStudio snapshots were pulled from <http://ayeimanol-r.net/2013/04/21/289/>\n",
