# SISMID `Introduction to R` Materials (2025)

This is the GitHub hosting the code and resources for the SISMID 2024 Intro
to R Module.

## About This Course

### Module Summary

This module aims to enhance R programming skills to prepare participants for advanced mechanistic and statistical infectious disease modeling. It employs an inquiry-based learning approach, using foundational infectious disease modeling tasks—such as writing and solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or optimizing functions—as a basis for identifying and teaching essential R programming skills. 
Hands-on use of R is a major component of this module; users require a laptop and will use it in all sessions. Examples and exercises will use data drawn from biological and medical applications, including infectious diseases and genetics. Participants require a laptop and will use it in all sessions. Suggested pairing: All later modules.

### Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of R, including how to open and write R scripts, read in data, and use basic functions and syntax.  Participants are also expected to have prior knowledge of basic descriptive statistics and regression modeling consistent with an introductory statistical course.

**Before class starts, you should install R (4.4.1 or newer), RStudio, and Quarto (1.6.0 or newer) on your computer!**

### Module Content:

- Create and use RMarkdown
- Write, use, and debug custom functions
- Implement basic functional programming tools such as apply() to manipulate data
- Write and use control flow tools, including loops and if/else statments
- Understand and implement of object-oriented programming, including writing and using object-oriented code (e.g., S3/S4)
- Write and use R formulas, and explore their utility in common functions
- Implement bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals
- Solve basic ordinary differential equations in R
- Optimize functions using the optim() function


## Repository file structure:

* `README.qmd`: controls what shows up here on the GitHub page.
* `index.qmd`: this is the website homepage.
* `schedule.qmd`: info on the course schedule and logistics
* `references.qmd`: any references for the course go in the .bib file and
get rendered on this page.
* `data` directory: contains datasets used in the course and exercises
* `exercises`: contains R or Rmd files for each of the exercises
* `format`: contains code to format the website appearance
* `images`: put static image files here
* `modules`: all of the modules go here. Each module gets its own folder with
an `index.qmd` page that holds the web page content and a separate document
for the slides.
* Everything else is housekeeping files needed for the website.
