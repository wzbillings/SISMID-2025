He is an alumnus of the Rollins School of Public Health, where he earned his Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) in 2017. Currently, Alex is pursuing his PhD at the Stellenbosch University, ZA, focusing on the spatial modeling of HIV multi-morbidity disorder in sub-Saharan Africa. Alex has published extensively on the intersection of HIV and non-communicable diseases, contributing valuable insights to the field. His dedication to advancing public health is evident in his teaching and research endeavors.\n\n\n\nCo-Instructor: Zane Billings\n\n\nZane Billings is a PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia, working with Andreas Handel. He has been using R since 2017, and uses R for nearly all of his statistics and data science practice. Zane’s research focuses on the immune response to influenza vaccination, and uses machine learning and multilevel regression modeling (in R!) to improve our understanding of influenza immunology.",
