## Learning goals

1. Fit basic linear and generalized linear models including models for counts.
1. Fit GLMs with interaction terms.
1. Fit GLMs with random effects using `lme4`.

Optional topics:
1. Fit GLMs with spline terms using `mgcv`.
1. Fit binomial and overdispersed binomial models, and compare them to bernoulli models on the same data.
1. Understand the limitations of frequentist linear models and know that `brms` exists.
