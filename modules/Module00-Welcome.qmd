## Overall Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to

1. Write code that uses advanced R programming tools like control flow and custom functions.
2. Use advanced R programming tools to answer interesting epidemiology questions.
3. Be (more) prepared to use R in other SISMID modules

## Workshop Overview

Multiple modules that will each:

-   Start with learning objectives
-   End with summary slides
-   Include mini-exercises or practice problems

Themes that will show up throughout the workshop:

-   Reproducibility
-   Good coding techniques
-   Thinking algorithmically

Note that we listed a lot of topics on the course description, we won't have time to get in-depth with most of them. What are **you** most interested in learning?

## Course structure

- We'll start the course with some fundamentals.
- These include advanced programming techniques, applications of those programming techniques, and just some neat things we think will help prepare you for infectious disease modeling.
- We'll have time to cover a few specialized topics, if we run out of time to cover them all, we'll do them in order of interest.

## Installing R

Hopefully everyone has pre-installed R and RStudio (and Quarto if needed). Let's take a minute to make sure everyone is set up and then jump in!
