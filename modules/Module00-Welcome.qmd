## What is R?

-   R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
    graphics developed in 1991

-   R is the open source implementation of the [S
    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)),
    which was developed by [Bell
    laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512)
    in the 70s.

-   The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to
    turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

## What is R?

-   **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of
    Auckland, New Zealand developed R

-   R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
    and [open
    development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)

```{r, fig.alt="R logo", out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

## What is R?

-   R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical
    methods
    -   includes machine learning algorithm, linear regression, time
        series, statistical inference to name a few.
-   Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming,
    transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results

## What is R?

-   Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
-   Transform: R is made up of a collection of packages/libraries
    designed specifically for statistical computing
-   Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze
    them
-   Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model
    for your data
-   Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R
    Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world

## Why R?

-   Free (open source)

-   High level language designed for statistical computing

-   Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and
    visualization

-   Extensive add-on software (packages)

-   Strong community

## Why not R?

-   Little centralized support, relies on online community and package
    developers

-   Annoying to update

-   Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional
    programming languages (C, Perl, Python)

## Is R Difficult?

-   Short answer â€“ It has a steep learning curve, like all programming
    languages
-   Years ago, R was a difficult language to master.
-   Hadley Wickham developed a collection of packages called tidyverse.
    Data manipulation became trivial and intuitive. Creating a graph was
    not so difficult anymore.

## Overall Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to

1.  start a new project, read in data, and conduct basic data
    manipulation, analysis, and visualization
2.  know how to use and find packages/functions that we did not
    specifically learn in class
3.  troubleshoot errors

## This workshop differs from "Introduction to Tidyverse"

We will focus this class on using **Base R** functions and packages,
i.e., pre-installed into R and the basis for most other functions and
packages! If you know Base R then are will be more equipped to use all
the other useful/pretty packages that exit.

The Tidyverse is one set of useful/pretty sets of packages, designed to
can make your code more **intuitive** as compared to the original older
Base R. **Tidyverse advantages**:

-   **consistent structure** - making it easier to learn how to use
    different packages
-   particularly good for **wrangling** (manipulating, cleaning,
    joining) data\
-   more flexible for **visualizing** data

```

## Workshop Overview

14 lecture blocks that will each:

-   Start with learning objectives
-   End with summary slides
-   Include mini-exercise(s) or a full exercise

Themes that will show up throughout the workshop:

-   Reproducibility
-   Good coding techniques
-   Thinking algorithmically
-   [Basic terms / R
    jargon](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4419-1318-0%2F1.pdf)

## Reproducibility

-   **Reproducible research**: the idea that other people should be able
    to verify the claims you make -- usually by being able to see your
    data and run your code.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "repspectrum.JPG"))
```

-   **2023 was the US government's year of open science** -- specific
    aspects of reproducibility will be mandated for federally funded
    research!
-   Sharing and documenting your code is a massive step towards making
    your work reproducible, and the R ecosystem can play a big role in
    that!

## Installing R

Hopefully everyone has pre-installed R and RStudio. We will take a
moment to go around and make sure everyone is ready to go. Please open
up your RStudio and leave it open as we check everyone's laptops.

-   Install the latest version from: <http://cran.r-project.org/>
-   [Install
    RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
