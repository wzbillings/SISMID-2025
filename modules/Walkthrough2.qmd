## A whole paper using R and quarto

- For this data science walkthough, I wanted to briefly walkthrough a paper I wrote a published that is done almost 100\% in R and Quarto.
- The analyses use a lot of tools that we've talked about, so we'll discuss how these can be useful.
- Please ask any questions you have!
- You can see the public code for the paper here: https://github.com/ahgroup/billings-high-dose-heterologous-public/.
