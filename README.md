# SISMID `Introduction to R` Materials (2024)

This is the GitHub hosting the code and resources for the SISMID 2024
Intro to R Module.

## About This Course

### Module Summary

This module introduces the R statistical environment, assuming no prior
knowledge. It provides a foundation for the use of R for computation in
later modules. In addition to discussing basic data management tasks in
R, such as reading in data and producing summaries through R scripts, we
will also introduce R’s graphics functions, its powerful package system,
and simple methods of looping.

Hands-on use of R is a major component of this module; users require a
laptop and will use it in all sessions. Examples and exercises will use
data drawn from biological and medical applications, including
infectious diseases and genetics. Participants require a laptop and will
use it in all sessions. Suggested pairing: All later modules.

### Prerequisites

This module assumes prior knowledge of basic descriptive statistics and
regression modeling consistent with an introductory statistical course.

Before starting the course, students should install the newest version
of R ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/)) and RStudio
([here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).

### Module Content

- Write and use R script.
- Create and use R projects and R Markdown files.
- Read and write data files
- Install and load R packages, and be able to access the help system and
  other resources to facilitate their use.
- Learn base R syntax
- Perform basic data manipulations (e.g. working with different data
  types, creating new variables, merging data sets).
- Use R to perform descriptive statistics including graphics.
- Perform basic inferential statistical analyses including regression
  analysis.
- Write and use R functions, and perform basic programming in R
  including loops.

## Repository file structure:

- `README.qmd`: controls what shows up here on the GitHub page.
- `index.qmd`: this is the website homepage.
- `schedule.qmd`: info on the course schedule and logistics
- `references.qmd`: any references for the course go in the .bib file
  and get rendered on this page.
- `data` directory: contains datasets used in the course and exercises
- `exercises`: contains R or Rmd files for each of the exercises
- `format`: contains code to format the website appearance
- `images`: put static image files here
- `modules`: all of the modules go here. Each module gets its own folder
  with an `index.qmd` page that holds the web page content and a
  separate document for the slides.
- Everything else is housekeeping files needed for the website.
